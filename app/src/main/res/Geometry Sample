This sample uses the Geometry engine in different ways to show off the capabilities the Geometry engine provides the user. The samples illustrate the use of following operations: Project, Buffer, Union, Difference, Measure and identification of Spatial Relationships. Each fragment lets the user explore these individually. The sample allows the user to draw geometries and modify them using each of the operations.

Features
1. Reproject Points and Polygons
2. Buffer Points, Lines, & Polygons
3. Find the Union and Difference between intersecting Polygons
4. Determine spatial relationships between polygons, e.g. touches, contains, etc.
5. Measure distance or area
6. Andriod Fragments

Sample Design

The sample has an opening Geometry Sample Activity which presents the different geometry tools you can use in the app. Choose a feature tool from the left hand ListFragment to open the feature tool and use it.
