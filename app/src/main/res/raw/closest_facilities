Sample Design

This sample uses the ClosestFacilityTask class to find the closest recreation facilities based on parameters set with ClosestFacilityParameters and results bundled in a ClosestFacilityResult server response. There are private fields for user credentials which if you edit the strings will automatically cause the sample to use the ArcGIS Online Network Analysis Service.
