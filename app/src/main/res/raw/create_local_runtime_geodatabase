This sample demonstrates the services pattern for generating a runtime geodatabase from a feature service.

Sample Design

This sample is designed to allow users to generate a runtime geodatabase on the device from a pre-defined feature service. Once successfully downloaded the features from the local runtime geodatabase are added to the MapView as an operational layer. The main API features used are the GenerateGeodatabaseParameters class to define the parameters to allow you to control features in the generated runtime geodatabase and GeodatabaseSyncTask class which creates the runtime geodatabase and downloads the file when it has been successfully created.

How to use the Sample

The sample starts up with a MapView containing the World Topographic Basemap. The action bar as a download icon that when pressed will initiate the creation, download, and adding the local runtime geodatabase features from the Wildfire Response Points Wildfire feature service. The runtime geodatabase file directory will be displayed in a TextView above the MapView. The default download location is <EXTERNAL-STORAGE-DIR>/ArcGIS/samples/CRGdb/wildfire.geodatase.
