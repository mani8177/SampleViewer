The DynamicLayerMapService sample illustrates how you can use the Dynamic Layer to render on the client side using the Dynamic Map Server. It is important to note that the DynamicLayerMapService executes in a separate thread from the main thread of the application. This allows the main thread to stay responsive while the query is being executed on the server and in the background.
