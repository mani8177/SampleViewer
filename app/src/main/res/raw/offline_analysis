The offline analysis app shows how to perform Line of Sight and Viewshed analysis on raster files provisioned on an android device. The Analysis features are a BETA API at v10.2.6 and are subject to change when the API goes final. We encourage any and all feedback on the API and it’s feature capability.

Features

Direct read of Raster files
Line of Sight analysis
Viewshed analysis
Override MapOnTouchListener for custom gestures
Sample Design

This sample has one class, MainActivity, which has two inner classes to override the MapOnTounchListener for custom gestures. The raster file local to your device is added to a MapView in the onCreate method. There are two Menu items added to the ActionBar in the OnCreateOptionsMenu method. The core functionality is provided by the performLOS and calculateViewShed methods. These show the patterns for Line of Sight and Viewshed analysis respectfully. The high level pattern is offered below:

Create an Analysis Object, LineOfSight or Viewshed, from a Raster
Create a (Raster)Layer from the analysis object
Set some observer features
Set an observer location, typically through interaction with the map, e.g. MapOnTounchListener
Add Raster File

You will need to provision a raster dem file to your android device prior to working with this sample. A list of supported raster types can be found here. You can put your raster file anywhere on your device that the app has access to. By default the app will look for your raster file starting from the primary external storage directory returned by Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() with ArcGIS/samples/OfflineAnalysis/ subdirectory. You can change the data path by editing the string.xml resource file. It is mandatory that you change the raster file name variable to point to your raster file. Open strings.xml and edit the following string resource variables:


    <string name="raster_dir">ArcGIS/samples/OfflineAnalysis</string>

    <string name="raster_file">RASTER_FILE_NAME</string>
Push file to device

The following adb command is used to push files to your device:

$ adb push <local> <remote>
In the commands, <local> and <remote> refer to the paths to the target file/directory on your development machine and the device. For Example:

$ adb push raster.tiff /sdcard/ArcGIS/samples/OfflineAnalysis/
More information about using the Android Debug Bridget can be found here.

Sample Usage

Spatial Analysis This sample app supports both Line of Sight and Viewshed analysis on an elevation raster type. The app will open to with the raster file as the basemap of the map.

Select the ActionBar overlay button
Choose between Line of Sight and Viewshed for analysis
Line of Sight

The default observer is the center of the map
Long press on the map to change the observer’s position
Single tap the map to change the target’s position and execute the Line of Sight function
Alternatively, you can drag-move on the map to change the target’s position
Viewshed

Single tap on the map to change the observer’s position and execute the Viewshed function
