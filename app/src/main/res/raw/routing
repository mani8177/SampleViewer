This sample demonstrates a simple user experience for finding a route between two points by long pressing on a street to calculate a route from your location to the geocoded location resulting from your long press. Additionally, the sample demonstrates a dialog to input start and destination locations to calculate a route.

The sample contains four files: 1.RoutingSample When the user long clicks on the map, the activity will do the Routing Task and create the Routing List Fragment 2.Routing List Fragment This fragment populates the Listview (Navigation Drawer) using a custom adapter 3. RoutingDialogFragment When the user clicks on the Get Direction button on the bottom layout, a dialog box appears in which the user can enter the source and destination addresses to get the route. It uses Geocoding to convert the addresses to the points on the map which then the Routing sample uses for routing. 4. MyAdapter Custom Adapter for the ListView.
